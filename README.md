## What Is VibeKit Framework?

VibeKit Framework is a **planning + building system** for vibe coders who use Claude Code/any agent to build real Next.js applications. It gives you:

- A **master prompt** that makes Claude Code write production-quality code (not AI slop)
- A **planning workflow** that generates 4 project files from your app idea
- **Reference guides** for database, deployment, environment variables, design, payments, and troubleshooting
- A **Claude Code skill** that enforces the framework standards automatically

## The Problems VibeKit Solves

Every vibe coder building with AI hits the same walls. VibeKit is designed to remove each one.

| Pain                              | What it looks like                                                                              | How VibeKit solves it                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI slop design**                | Every app looks the same — purple gradients, generic shadcn defaults, no brand identity         | `design-style-guide.md` is customized per project (colors, typography, spacing, component specs) and Claude Code follows it exactly       |
| **Inconsistent UI**               | Buttons, cards, and forms look slightly different on every page                                 | Design tokens defined in one place, enforced by the master prompt across every component                                                  |
| **Shipping broken auth**          | AI writes insecure login flows, missing password reset, no OAuth, session bugs                  | `jb-components.md` points Claude to install JB Better Auth UI — battle-tested auth in one command                                         |
| **Burning tokens**                | $100–$200 per project because AI rewrites boilerplate every time (auth, tables, forms, uploads) | JB Component Registry covers the big primitives — AI installs and wires up instead of writing from scratch (saves 60–80% tokens)          |
| **Getting stuck in loops**        | AI tries the same broken fix repeatedly, context gets polluted, progress stalls                 | Phase-based build (`project-phases.md`) + rescue prompts in `prompt-engineering.md` + `troubleshooting.md` playbook                       |
| **No plan, no clarity**           | Starting with "build me a SaaS" and hoping for the best                                         | Claude interviews you first, generates `project-description.md` + `project-phases.md` — a clear blueprint before a single line is written |
| **Tech stack chaos**              | AI picks a different stack every project — jsPDF here, Drizzle there, useEffect for data        | Master prompt locks the stack: Next.js 16 + Prisma v7 + React Query + Zod + @react-pdf/renderer + xlsx — always                           |
| **Prisma version drift**          | AI mixes Prisma v6 and v7 patterns, breaks the build                                            | Master prompt enforces Prisma v7 patterns exactly (generator, custom output path, adapter-pg)                                             |
| **Deployment confusion**          | App works locally, breaks in production — env vars, DNS, SSL, email spam                        | `deployment.md` + `environment-variables.md` walk through every step with checklists                                                      |
| **Vague prompts = vague code**    | "Make it look better" produces unpredictable changes that break other things                    | `prompt-engineering.md` teaches the 5-part formula and context-loading technique                                                          |
| **Payment setup hell**            | Stripe keys, webhooks, feature gating, billing pages — most builds never ship monetization      | `monetization-guide.md` + JB Stripe UI component handle the full flow                                                                     |
| **Losing track of progress**      | Mid-build, no idea what's done vs. what's left                                                  | Phase tasks in `project-phases.md` are checkboxes — Claude Code checks them off as it goes                                                |
| **No rescue plan when AI breaks** | Build stalls for hours because AI keeps making it worse                                         | Rescue prompts + hard-reset protocol + the V0 bypass technique in `prompt-engineering.md`                                                 |

## 📺 Watch the Crash Course

The fastest way to learn VibeKit is to watch the full crash course where I build a real Hardware POS system from scratch in about 3 hours — every prompt, every command, end-to-end.

[![VibeKit Framework Crash Course](https://14j7oh8kso.ufs.sh/f/HLxTbDBCDLwf0VdAvuLtvnF3cx4uPCTU9aqg2f0oY8klybGQ)](https://youtu.be/TvGu_Tu-6UI)

▶ **[Watch on YouTube → VibeKit Framework Crash Course](https://youtu.be/TvGu_Tu-6UI)**

The written version with copyable prompts is also on the site: [vibekit.desishub.com/tutorial](https://vibekit.desishub.com/tutorial).

---

## How To Use This Framework

### Step 0 — Check your environment (2 min, optional but recommended)

Before anything else, make sure your machine has Node 20+, pnpm 9+, git, and gh CLI installed. The fastest check: copy the OS-specific prompt from [`setup-prompts/`](./setup-prompts) (macOS / Windows / Linux) and paste it into your AI coding agent. It runs a single safe shell command and tells you exactly what's installed and what to fix — without touching your system. Or visit [vibekit.desishub.com/setup](https://vibekit.desishub.com/setup) for the full guide with one-click copy.

### Step 1 — Copy the planning prompt

Copy the contents of [`CLAUDE_PROMPT.md`](./CLAUDE_PROMPT.md) from this repository.

### Step 2 — Open Claude

Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and start a new conversation.

### Step 3 — Paste and add your idea

Paste the contents of `CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` into Claude, then add your app idea at the bottom:

```
[CLAUDE_PROMPT.md contents pasted here]

MY IDEA: I want to build a school management system where teachers can manage students,
track attendance, and parents can log in to see their child's progress and pay school fees.
```

### Step 4 — Answer Claude's questions

Claude will ask you 6–10 questions about your project. Answer honestly and completely.

### Step 5 — Get your 4 project files

Claude will generate:

| File                     | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project-description.md` | Complete description of your app — features, data model, pages, integrations    |
| `project-phases.md`      | Build blueprint with phases, tasks, and install commands                        |
| `design-style-guide.md`  | Fully customized visual design system (colors, typography, spacing, components) |
| `prompt.md`              | The prompt you paste into Claude Code to start building                         |

Save all 4 files into your project root folder.

### Step 6 — Copy the framework files

Copy these 2 files from this repository into your project root:

- [`master_prompt.md`](./master_prompt.md) — Tech stack rules, Prisma v7 patterns, coding standards
- [`jb-components.md`](./jb-components.md) — JB component registry reference (when to use each)

### Step 7 — Start building with Claude Code

Open Claude Code in your project directory and paste the contents of `prompt.md`. Claude Code will:

1. Read `master_prompt.md`, `design-style-guide.md`, `jb-components.md`, `project-description.md`, and `project-phases.md`
2. Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)
3. Install JB components before writing from scratch
4. Stop after each phase for your confirmation
5. Follow the design system and coding standards exactly

### Files to copy into your project

When starting a new project, copy these from the VibeKit repo into your project root:

| File                   | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `master_prompt.md`     | Claude Code reads this first — tech stack + coding rules |
| `jb-components.md`     | Reference for when to install which JB component         |
| `pre-deploy-review.md` | Paste into Claude Code before deploying for an audit     |

Claude (in the planning step) will generate `project-description.md`, `project-phases.md`, `design-style-guide.md`, and `prompt.md` for you.

---

## Pre-Deploy Code Review

Before shipping to production, run [`pre-deploy-review.md`](./pre-deploy-review.md) in Claude Code. It performs a senior-level audit covering:

- **Performance** — N+1 queries, missing pagination, expensive operations
- **Security** — unauthenticated routes, SQL injection, missing rate limiting, exposed secrets
- **Background tasks** — webhook idempotency, job retries, distributed locks
- **Resource consumption** — memory leaks, unclosed streams, missing timeouts

Claude Code writes the findings to `pre-deploy-review-report.md`. Address every Critical issue before deploying. This is a phase task in every VibeKit project.

---

## JB Component Registry

**Registry Reference:** [jb.desishub.com/blog/jb-component-registry-complete-reference](https://jb.desishub.com/blog/jb-component-registry-complete-reference)

**Framework Reference:** [`jb-components.md`](./jb-components.md) — Detailed guide with install commands, env vars, prerequisites, and when-to-use for each major component.

Production-ready shadcn components for auth, data tables, forms, file uploads, e-commerce, and more. Claude Code checks `jb-components.md` before building features from scratch.

---

## Contributing

VibeKit is community-driven — every component in the registry was built by someone shipping with AI in production. **We're actively looking for new components.**

If you've built something reusable — auth flow, payment widget, AI feature, dashboard primitive, search component — please contribute it. Once merged:

- Your component gets a permanent doc page at `vibekit.desishub.com/components/<slug>`
- It's listed in [`jb-components.md`](./jb-components.md), which every Claude Code agent reads
- It becomes part of the framework's default toolkit across thousands of builds

**Read the full contribution guide:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Quick start:**

1. Build & host your component (shadcn-compatible registry)
2. Write a doc page anywhere accessible
3. Fork, edit `web/src/lib/components-data.ts`, append your entry using [the schema](./CONTRIBUTING.md#the-component-schema)
4. Open a PR with the `new-component.md` template — we review weekly

Other contributions (docs fixes, framework refinements, bug reports) are also welcome — open an issue or PR.
